# Interactive 3D Room Visualization in OpenGL

A 3D visualization project built using OpenGL and GLUT, showcasing an interactive room model with adjustable views, doors, windows, and interactive mouse-based controls.  
This project demonstrates the use of geometric primitives, transformations, and camera manipulation in a 3D environment.

## Features
- Rendered 3D room structure with realistic elements like walls, doors, and windows.  
- Adjustable camera angles via mouse and keyboard controls.  
- Interactive components such as doors and window visualization.  
- Smooth rotation and motion using mouse drag.

## Requirements
- OpenGL and GLUT library installed.  
- Compatible with Windows or macOS (with proper GLUT setup).
